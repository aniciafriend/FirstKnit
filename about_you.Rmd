# A Little Survey

Here are just a few questions so I can get to know you and so you can get practice submitting an assignment in Canvas.  For each question, insert your answer underneath. Make sure each answer is at the minimum a complete sentence with correctly spelled words and correct puncuation. 

## A short history of you.  
Where did you attend High School, and did you graduate? Compare english class to math, is one easier for you than the other? Finally which subject did you do the best in? Your answer should have at least two sentences devoted to each question.  
  
### my answer     
  
I attended high school at Quartz Hill High school.I also graduated on the principles list in 2022. I like both English and math but math was always the easier one for me. English and write was never really easy for me it took a long time to think about what I want to write about. I think math was easier because I always liked to work with numbers. Number just click with me and unlike English where you write and have to create multiple parts math you have somewhere to start with the numbers and don't have to do much research. Do to me liking math so much I definitely did the best in that subject. 


## Your computer and your and its capability?  
 For this class  you need a computer you can use at home.  So, what kind is it (windows, Apple, Linux)?  On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a total dummy (doesn't know a mouse from a keyboard) and 10 is a complete geek (knows computer stuff in and out) How do you rate yourself?  You also need to have have internet access. How is your connection to the internet where you live?

### my answer   
  I have multiple devices I own and can use to complete this class. The two devices I do have are an apple tablet and a windows 11 laptop. I would rate myself about a 4 in understand how technology works. I can open work and do most things but once it gets a little complex I start to loss it. I have internet access and it works perfectly fine. Sometime my internet can lag or be slow but it never goes out. 
   

## Others and You?   
What name do you prefer to be called by your classmates and instructor, if your buddys call you something but you want people in the class to call you something else - what would that be? 

### my answer     
  
   I prefer to be called Anicia. All of my life my friends, family, and classmates have called me this. I don't go by any nicknames. 
 




## Aspirations?   
What do you want to achieve in life?  What college subject do you think would be of the greatest interest to you? What degree or certificate are you trying to achieve?

### my answer     
  
   I want to be able to have my own car and house with extra money to spend and not to many things to worry about. I think the subject that would be the most interest to would be and has been psychology it is so interesting to learn why people are the way they are. I am trying to achieve a degree in Dentistry so I can become a nurse or even a dental doctor in the field. 
 




## Past adventures?  
Have you ever gone to foreign countries, if so which ones, if not Where might you go in the future?  Have you ever been in the military, if so which branch, if not which branch would you choose if you got drafted, and why?

### my answer     
  
   I have never been to a different country but if I were to go to one I would choose Switzerland. I have always heard great thing about this place and I love the environment and the weather there. I also have never been in the military but the branch I would join if I was drafted would have to be the marines because I know a lot of people who have join that branch and have recommended it to me. 
  




## Why are you taking Statistics?  
Did you take Math 115 or Math 116 ?  Did you know Math 115 only satisfies a general education requirement but that Math 116 counts as taking statistics in several transfer institutions??  
What grade do you need to attain in stats to not upset your future plans, What is your plan?  
 

### my answer     
  
   
 I did not take math 115 and only math 116 because it is what I needed as you mentioned to transfer. I need at least a C but if all turns out well I would hope for a high B or A because it would be the best outcome for me. My plan is just to graduate and finish what I need with all good grades hopefully but not having a B or A wont really stop me or mess any of my plans up.
