# A Little Survey

Here are just a few questions so I can get to know you and so you can get practice submitting an assignment in Canvas.  For each question, insert your answer underneath. Make sure each answer is at the minimum a complete sentence with correctly spelled words and correct puncuation. 

## A short history of you.  
Where did you attend High School, and did you graduate? Compare english class to math, is one easier for you than the other? Finally which subject did you do the best in? Your answer should have at least two sentences devoted to each question.  
  
### my answer     
  
I attended high school at Quartz Hill High school.I also graduated on the principles list in 2022. I like both English and math but math was always the easier one for me. English and write was never really easy for me it took a long time to think about what I want to write about. I think math was easier because I always liked to work with numbers. Number just click with me and unlike English where you write and have to create multiple parts math you have somewhere to start with the numbers and don't have to do much research. Do to me liking math so much I definitely did the best in that subject.
